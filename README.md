### RTlib - Real-Time and High-Performance Control Library ###


RTlib philosophy is that it is possible to design control software in
Java for high-performance microscopes with a minimum of native code by
leveraging the best Java practices and libraries available. 

Current version: 1.0


### How to build the project? ###

* Building RTlib
To build RTlib you need Gradle build tool - http://www.gradle.org/overview
Tip: Make sure that the gradle executable is in your path.

to build the project:

    gradle build

To generate eclipse project files:

    gradle eclipse

To clean-up modified eclipse project files:

    gradle cleanEclipse

That's it, now you can import all RTlib projects in Eclipse. 


* Dependencies
Some dependencies could not be found online - they are added into the Libs folder for now...

### Work in PROGRESS!!!! ###

Currently the maturity of the code in the different packages can be estimated by the number of tests and whether they pass...
Documentation will follow after code has stabilised.
